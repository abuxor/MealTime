## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the Meal Time repository on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and commit them with clear, concise messages.
4. Submit a pull request detailing your changes and the problem you're addressing.

### Development 

You can setup a development environment for Meal Time using `docker` and `docker-compose`.

Before starting the development environment please make sure to set environment variables for all services:

- api: set `env.properties` file on `/api/src/main/resources`
- web: set `.env` file on `/web`

You can refer to the `.example` files to understand what values need to be set.

Change your current working directory to the root of the project and run the following command first:

```bash
$ docker-compose run --rm start_dependencies
```
This will make sure the mysql server is up and running before the other services start. 

Then you can start the rest of the services:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

If you are working on a specific service you can also start only that service and dependencies by running:

```bash
$ docker-compose up <service-name>
# for example:
$ docker-compose up api
```
